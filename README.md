### Build process

Once Gulp is installed the extension is built by running the following:

	gulp

To build the extension for Chrome, Firefox or Opera only run `gulp chrome`, `gulp firefox` or `gulp opera` respectively.

When the extension is built it creates `build/chrome`, `build/firefox` and `build/opera` directories as well as packaged versions of the extensions `build/web-developer-chrome.zip`, `build/web-developer-firefox.xpi`, `build/web-developer-opera.nex`.

The extension can be installed in Chrome or Opera by loading the unpacked extension in `build/chrome` or `build/opera` respectively as described in the [Chrome](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/getstarted.html#load-ext) and [Opera](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/testing/) documentation.
The extension can be installed in Firefox by installing `build/web-developer-firefox.xpi` like a regular extension.
